We are now starting PHASE 2 of SIH26118.

Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and android/MIGRATION_MAP.md first.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT redesign the architecture.
Do NOT revert to C++.
Do NOT delete the Python reference.
Do NOT modify the chemistry or invent calibration data.

The target architecture is:

Android
→ Kotlin
→ OpenCV Android SDK where required
→ local image-processing pipeline

The Python implementation under:

reference/python/

is the GOLDEN REFERENCE.

Our goal is to port its functionality to Kotlin incrementally while preserving behavior.

==================================================
PHASE 2 GOAL
==================================================

Begin migrating the Python reference engine into Kotlin.

DO NOT attempt to convert the entire engine in one shot.

Work module-by-module and verify each module against the Python reference before moving forward.

==================================================
STEP 0 — RE-SCAN CURRENT REPOSITORY
==================================================

Before modifying anything:

1. Scan the CURRENT repository.
2. Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
3. Read android/MIGRATION_MAP.md.
4. Inspect the current Android project.
5. Inspect the relevant Python reference modules.
6. Inspect the CURRENT OpenCV dependency/version actually configured in Gradle.

Do not rely on previous folder structures or assumptions.

==================================================
STEP 1 — IDENTIFY THE FIRST MODULE
==================================================

Determine the safest first module to migrate.

Prefer starting with a small, deterministic component such as:

reference/python/engine/badge_spec.py

or another module you determine is a better first target.

Explain:

- what the Python module does
- what inputs it accepts
- what outputs it produces
- what dependencies it has
- what Kotlin class/package should represent it
- how we can test equivalence

DO NOT write the full migration yet until this analysis is complete.

==================================================
STEP 2 — PRESERVE THE PYTHON REFERENCE
==================================================

The files under:

reference/python/

must remain unchanged unless I explicitly approve a change.

Do not "clean up" or rewrite Python code just to make Kotlin easier.

==================================================
STEP 3 — KOTLIN IMPLEMENTATION
==================================================

Once the module is understood and the migration approach is clear:

Implement ONLY that module in Kotlin.

Follow the existing Android package architecture.

Keep:

- geometry/configuration separate from CV
- CV separate from colour math
- colour math separate from calibration
- calibration separate from exposure estimation

Do not hard-code experimental H2S calibration as if it were real.

==================================================
STEP 4 — VERIFICATION
==================================================

Create appropriate tests or comparison tooling where practical.

The objective is:

Python reference input
→ Python output

and

same input
→ Kotlin output

should agree within explicitly justified numerical tolerances.

If exact equivalence is impossible because of OpenCV/API differences, explain why and define the tolerance.

Do NOT simply say "looks correct."

==================================================
STEP 5 — CONTEXT LOG
==================================================

After the module is successfully implemented and verified, update:

PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

with a SHORT entry containing:

- module migrated
- Kotlin location
- verification result
- important decisions
- limitations
- next module

Do not fill the file with code.

==================================================
CRITICAL RULES
==================================================

Do NOT:

- migrate the entire engine at once
- create a giant monolithic BadgeEngine.kt
- rename old concepts without checking their underlying assumptions
- invent wristband dimensions
- invent H2S calibration coefficients
- treat Na2S liquid testing as H2S calibration
- modify the golden Python reference unnecessarily
- delete legacy files
- build the final UI yet
- add unnecessary backend functionality
- make irreversible changes without showing me first

Use the existing architecture.

At the end of this step, STOP and show me:

1. What module you recommend migrating first
2. Why
3. Its Python behavior
4. Proposed Kotlin class/package
5. Dependencies
6. Testing strategy
7. Exact files you intend to create/modify

Wait for approval before implementing the first module.







Create a simple polished demo UI for the Android app using the existing project structure. Put it under the ui package. Do not modify the Python reference implementation, CV pipeline, calibration logic, Gradle/OpenCV configuration, or backend. The UI should be standalone/mock-only for now. Add a home screen for ‘MRPL H₂S Dosimeter’ with a Scan Wristband button, View History button, and a sample dose/TWA/status card. Make sure the app launches directly into this screen and builds successfully.
